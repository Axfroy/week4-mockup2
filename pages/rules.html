                yards.Leagues, districts or associations participating in the state
                competition program that are unable to provide a field that meets these
                minimum requirements must advise the State Competition Board which will
                assign its Fields Committee to inspect the field and recommend to the
                Board whether or not a waiver of the minimum dimensions should be
                granted. Teams from leagues, districts or associations that are unable
                to provide an acceptable field may be required to play all their games
                away.
